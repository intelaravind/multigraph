Multigraph


Installation
============

After cloning/downloading the source code, follow these steps.

• run “install.sh”. This script will install the MultiGraph framework and all its dependencies. In addition, it will install the other compared frameworks: Gunrock, Cusha, Groute and Warp Segmentation.

• run “download_datasets.sh”. This script will download all the datasets. The results section of the paper contain results with the original dataset and an isomorphic graph obtained by randomly re-numbering vertices. Both original and randomly renumbered datasets will get downloaded by the script.

Experiment workflow
===================

Ensure that the framework and associated dependencies are installed properly. Download the datasets using the “download_datasets.sh” script. To run the benchmarks use the “benchmark.sh” script.
